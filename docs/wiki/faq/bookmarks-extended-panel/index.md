# Working with bookmarks in the extended panel (Ribbon bookmarks)

> In Librera, you can display an extended bookmarks bar (Ribbon bookmarks) on the reading screen. It serves for the function of quickly adding a bookmark, switching between bookmarks.

In order to enable it, you must:

* Click the settings icon
* Go to settings "Status bar"
* Enable the extended bookmark panel (Ribbon bookmarks) checkbox in the reading mode you want.

**If you no longer need an extended bookmarks bar (Ribbon bookmarks), you can disable it by unchecking the status bar settings checkbox from your reading mode. The bookmark icon from the top right corner will be removed.**
