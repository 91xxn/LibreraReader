# Updating Your Library
> Once you have added books to your Library or removed some stuff from it, you need to update it to reflect those changes.
* Tap on the update icon to start updating the library.
* In the slide-out **Preferences** tab, you can specify some extra folders for **Librera** to look for books in.
* You can also delete entire folders from the list of ones to be scanned for books.
* Once you've made changes to the list of eligible file-types, a prompt will appear in a couple of seconds for you to confirm the changes.
