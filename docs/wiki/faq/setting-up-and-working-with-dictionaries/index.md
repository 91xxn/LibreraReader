# Setting up and working with dictionaries

> When reading books, you may need to look up the meaning of a word you don't know in a dictionary. Librera allows you to work with many dictionaries, getting information on words in one click.

Librera supports online and offline dictionaries.

* **Online**-without downloading the dictionary to your mobile device, if you have access to the Internet. Information on the meaning of your word will be shown in the Internet browser.
* **Offline**-when the dictionary is downloaded to your mobile device, the information is displayed in the dictionary program or in its pop-up window.

If you have not found the necessary dictionary you can send a proposal to add it to the mail librera.reader@gmail.com or make an issue on github.
